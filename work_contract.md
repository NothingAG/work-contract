**Nothing AG** (us) <!-- Keep the two whitespace after this comment to ensure line break -->  
Kirchstrasse 175, 3084 Wabern, Switzerland

_and_

**{First name Last name}** (you) <!-- Keep the two whitespace after this comment to ensure line break -->  
Date of birth: {Month date, year} / Place of origin: {XXX} <!-- Keep the two whitespace after this comment to ensure line break -->

## Assignment and place of work

Together, we will design products which matter. For this, you’ll adopt several roles in our **areas of competence**, which are, primarily, business, design and technology. Using your personal mission statement, you’ll actively participate in forming your fields of activity in order to be successful with the team.

You will mainly take care of your tasks **remotely**.

We look forward to our employment relationship from **{start date}**. Our employment relationship is valid indefinitely.

## Work amount and salary

You work on an **hourly basis** on **{Tasks description}**.

As an employee on an hourly basis, you are entitled to an **hourly gross salary**:

|                                                |                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Hourly rate without surcharges                 | CHF {XX.XX}     |
| Surcharges holiday compensation (10.65%)       | CHF {XX.XX}     |
| Surcharges public holiday compensation (2.27%) | CHF {XX.XX}     |
| **Hourly rate**                                | **CHF {XX.XX}** |

<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

## Working hours and tracking

The duration and **location** of the work shall be determined by **mutual agreement**. These are irregular assignments that are compensated on an hourly basis and not part-time assignments.

We don’t enforce specific work hours. However, we would like to point out that we do not have a permit for night work (from 23:00 to 06:00) and for working on Sundays. Please refrain from working during these time periods.

We kindly ask you to **transparently report your worked hours on the end of every month**.

## Holidays and free time

You are entitled to **5 weeks of holidays per working year**. Since you are employed on an hourly basis, we will add a surcharge for holidays and public holidays to your hourly rate.

## Termination and periods of cancellation

To keep a certain flexibility for both of us, this work contract can be cancelled from either side with a **cancellation period of 1** **month** during the **first working year**.

If we decide to continue our work relationship after that first year, we can start thinking more long term. As of the **second working year**, this work contract can be terminated by you or by us with a **cancellation period of 3 months**.

## Insurance

Since your average working time will be below 8 hours/week, the completion of a non-occupational accident insurance policy will not be provided by Nothing.

## Secrecy and prohibition of competition

We both guarantee to **not disclose** any data which we have received from the other party and which is not evident or public domain.

You guarantee to not engage in any **direct** or **indirect** commercial activity with our clients, both while you are working for us and for an additional **2 years** after cancellation of our work contract. This rule only applies in directly competing cases of rivalry.

## Core values and rules of conduct

We cherish having a good atmosphere at work and we strive to have a good relationship with our clients. For this reason, it is important that you can relate to our core values.

Our core values are the following:

**Simple**

- **No nonsense:** We cut the bullshit, get to the point and work only on what makes a difference.

**Human**

- **Compassion:** We put people first and respect the needs of every human being – peers, users, and anyone else.
- **Trust:** We are open with others, distribute power and talk about tensions to build trusting relationships.

**Open**

- **Transparency:** We expose and explain our (sometimes unfinished) work and processes, internally and externally.
- **Learning and growth:** We test our work, improve it based on feedback and learn from failure.

## Signatures

This work contract will be signed by both parties. It becomes valid with your and our signature. Each of us will receive a signed copy of this work contract.

Wabern, {contract date}
